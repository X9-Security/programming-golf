#Programming Golf!

This Programming Golf event is an application login that is focusing on length and security.
You will be judged by the length of the code in byte size, and may get extra points with the overall security of the code such as implementing features like brute-force detection

These are the following requirements:
Using both username and password in log in
Being able to log in
Being able to create a new user
Writing from scratch (No external libraries)

It is taking place from the 4th of April until the 4th of May. You can join our community and discuss this event on https://discord.io/x9sec
Apply to become a member from our X9 Security Github to apply your code. https://github.com/X9-Security/programming-golf

Best of luck!
